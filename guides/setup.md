# Setup PlatformIO

To write code and upload to the Arduino you need to set up a workspace.
In this workshop and in FEUP classes is often used PlatformIO that offers more features than Arduino IDE and is a good tool to develop to various types of microcontrollers besides Arduino.

To setup PlatformIO follow the official guide [here](https://platformio.org).
